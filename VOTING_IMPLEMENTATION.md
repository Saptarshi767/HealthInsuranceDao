## 🎯 How to Use

### Testing Current Implementation
1. Navigate to the voting page (`/voting` route)
2. Click on any claim to expand details
3. Use "Approve" or "Reject" buttons to vote
4. Watch real-time updates in the statistics dashboard
5. Process payouts for approved claims

### Smart Contract Deployment (When Ready)

#### 1. Install Hardhat Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your-infura-project-id
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

#### 3. Deploy to Local Network
```bash
# Start local Hardhat node
npx hardhat node

# Deploy contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

#### 4. Deploy to Testnet
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

#### 5. Update Configuration
Update `src/contracts/contractConfig.js` with your deployed contract address.

#### 6. Switch to Real Contract
Replace `useMockVoting` with `useVoting` in your components.
